# MATH 560 Mathematical Biology

Welcome to my notes and source code for MATH 560 Mathematical Biology, a UBC graduate course. 

This repository is divided into two sections: notes and project. See the links below to access the section of interest.

## Notes
Instead of providing a comprehensive dive into lecture material (something for which LaTeX is better suited), the notes displayed in the README files are meant to provide a brief overview of different models and analyses.

- [Section 1: Lotkaâ€“Volterra Models](https://github.com/mattfaltyn/MATH-560/tree/main/1-lotka)
- [Section 2: Epidemiology Models](https://github.com/mattfaltyn/MATH-560/tree/main/2-epi)

## Project
The objective of final group project for MATH-560 is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of various modeling formalisms by directly comparing two or more formalisms. See final project [here](https://github.com/mattfaltyn/MATH-560/tree/main/project).
