# MATH 560 Mathematical Biology

## Project
The objective of final group project for MATH-560 is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of various modeling formalisms by directly comparing two or more formalisms. See final project [here](https://github.com/mattfaltyn/MATH-560/tree/main/project).
