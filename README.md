## 1. Lotka–Volterra Models

### Summary of Models
The Lotka-Volterra models attempt to model the population dynamics of two species as they interact with one another in some manner. The interaction type (predator-prey, competition, etc) defines system of differential equations and parameters:

#### Predator-Prey Equations

What is going on in these equations? Let x be the prey population, y be the predator population, t be time, dx/dt be the change in prey population, dy/dt be the change in predator population, and all of the other parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) be real coefficients that describe the interaction dynamics between the two populations,

Here are some assumptions of the predator-prey model:
- prey has infinite food supply and appetite 
- the predator only eats the prey and have infinite appetite
- population dynamics are proportional to the population size
- no enviornmental or evolutionary forces are taken into account
