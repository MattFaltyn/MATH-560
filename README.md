# ODEs vs LSTM-RNNs: Modeling HIV Viral Dynamics

## Project Summary
We train and evaluate several Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network models in the task of predicting HIV viral dynamics using a 
synthetic dataset generated from running simulations of a phagocytosis based logistic clearance model.

## Source Code
See the [Software/Final folder](https://github.com/mattfaltyn/MATH-560/tree/main/project/Software/Final) to access the MATLAB and Python source code. 
As of  March 14, 2022, the source code is functionally complete; comments will be added to make the files more legible.
