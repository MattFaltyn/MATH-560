# ODEs vs LSTM-RNNs: Modeling HIV Viral Dynamics

## Project Summary
We train and evaluate several Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network models in the task of predicting HIV viral dynamics using a 
synthetic dataset generated from running simulations of a phagocytosis based logistic clearance model.
